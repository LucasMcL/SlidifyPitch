## What is the Golden Ratio?

- The golden ratio is a mathematical constant that can be discovered as follows:
  - Given a line segmend, divide it into two sections, a and b.
  - Adjust the length of a so that the ratio of the total length to a is equal to the ratio of a to b.
  - This ratio is approximately 1.618... and is defined as the golden ratio

## The Golden Ratio (con't)

- The exact value of the Golden Ratio is as follows:
$$ \phi = \frac12 + \frac{\sqrt5}2 = \frac{1 + \sqrt5}2 $$
- It can also be approximated using the fibonacci and another iterative process.
- My Shiny app uses interactive elements to demonstrate this.
- The following slides contain some examples from the web app.

## The Fibonacci Sequence

- This image shows fibonacci ratios (that is, the value of one fibonacci number divided by the previous) at various points in the fibonacci sequence.
- As you can see, these ratios converge to the golden ratio.
- In the web app, the user will be able to input different values for n and see different graphs.

```{r fibPlot, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=5}
make_fibRatios <- function(n){
  ratios <- numeric(length = n - 1)
  fibSequence <- fibonacci(n, sequence = T)
  
  for(i in 1:(n-1)){
    ratios[i] <- round(fibSequence[i + 1] / fibSequence[i], 3)
  }
  ratios
}
n = 6
df <- data.frame(x = 1:(n-1), y = make_fibRatios(n))
g <- ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y))
g + geom_line() + geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 1.618)) +
    ggtitle("Fibonacci Ratios") +
    xlab("nth Fibonacci Ratio") + ylab("Ratio") +
    geom_text(data = NULL, x = .75 * n, y = 1.9, label = paste("n =", n)) +
    geom_text(data = NULL, x = .75 * n, y = 1.8, label = paste("Fibonacci ratio =", df$y[n-1])) +
    geom_text(data = NULL, x = .75 * n, y = 1.7, label = paste("Golden ratio =", 1.618))
```

## A Simple Algorithm

- The following iterative process also converges to the golden ratio: $$ \frac1x + 1 $$
- My web app allows the user to pick a starting number and then view the first 10 iterations.
- Here is an exmaple using the starting number 5 and only showing 6 iterations.

```{r itFig, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 3, fig.align = "center", results = "asis"}
library(xtable)
make_iterations <- function(x){
  iterations <- character(length = 10)
  for(i in 1:10){
    iterations[i] <- paste("1 /", round(x, 3), "+ 1 =", round(1/x+1, 3))
    x <- 1/x + 1
  }
  iterations
}
x <- 5
its <- make_iterations(x)
table <- data.frame(x = its[1:6])
xt <- xtable(table)
print(xt, type = "html")
```
